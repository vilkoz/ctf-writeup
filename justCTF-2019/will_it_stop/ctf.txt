Vesim is a CS student. This semester he is really struggling to pass computability and formal language
theory course. He asked for a last chance, so the professor gave him a task: "For a given Python program, tell
me if it will eventually stop or not!". Sadly Vesim was pwning and reversing so he didnâ€™t have time to solve this
problem. Could you help him?
The professor agreed to host the submission system on his private server.
Funny fact: At home the professor has a wide collection of flags from all over the world!
